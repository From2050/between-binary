# Project History: The Brain Dump
*A comprehensive record of the design evolution, architectural decisions, and philosophical underpinnings of "Between Binary" (From2050).*

## 📅 Initial State & The "Why"
**Where we started:**
- The site was running on **Hexo** (Butterfly theme).
- It worked, but it was "just a blog". It felt static.
- **The Problem**: You carry a vision of a "VR Immersive Academy" and a "Digital Garden". Hexo's rigid "post-by-date" structure fought against this. You couldn't easily embed a 3D React component into a standard Markdown blog post without hacking the theme.
- **The Goal**: Move to **Astro**. Why? Because it brings the "Garden" (static content) and the "Lab" (React/interactive content) together seamlessly.

## 🧠 Design Evolution: The Search for "Soul"

### Phase 1: The "Clean but Cold" Prototype (V1)
*The default engineer approach.*
- **Action**: I built a standard Astro + Tailwind site.
- **Result**: It was fast, clean, and dark.
- **Critique**: It looked like a generic "Developer Portfolio". It had "nodes" and "networks", but they looked like server diagrams. It lacked *humanity*.
- **Key Realization**: "Cyberpunk" or "High-Tech" often ends up feeling cold and dystopian. That is **not** what From2050 represents.

### Phase 2: The "Humanistic Tech" Pivot (V2)
*The "Warmth" Directive.*
- **Your Feedback**: You specifically asked for "Warmth" and an "Organic" feel. You didn't want the site to feel like a machine.
- **The Shift**:
    - **Metaphor Change**: We moved from "Network Nodes" (rigid, wired) to "Particles" (fluid, floating, alive).
    - **Color Theory**: We abandoned the "Matrix Green" or "Cyber Blue". We introduced a **"Sunset/Cosmic" palette**—deep purples blending into warm oranges. It signals: "Technology that serves life," not "Technology that consumes life."
    - **Glassmorphism**: We used frosted glass cards. This adds depth and texture, making the UI feel tactile, like a physical object, rather than flat pixels.

### Phase 3: The "Laboratory" Identity (V3)
*Defining the space.*
- We struggled with what to call things. "Posts"? "Articles"? "Projects"?
- **The Taxonomy Decision**:
    1.  **Garden**: Knowledge that grows. These are verified guides, wikis, and structured learning.
    2.  **Lab**: Experiments. These are rough, interactive, and prototypes.
    3.  **Thoughts**: Essays and opinions. The human voice.
- **Why this matters**: This isn't just naming; it sets **expectations**. A user entering the "Lab" expects things might break but will be cool. A user in the "Garden" expects reliability.

## 🏗 Architecture: The "Topic-First" Revolution
*The most critical structural decision we made.*

### The Conflict
Traditional blogs organize by **Format**: "Here are my Videos," "Here are my Posts."
But a user interested in **Virtual Reality** doesn't care about format. They want *everything* you know about VR—the essay, the demo, and the notes.

### The Solution: Aggregated Topic Pages
We flipped the hierarchy.
- **Old Way**: User clicks "Blog" -> Searches for "VR".
- **New Way**: User sees a "VR" card on the home page -> Clicks it -> **The system fetches**:
    - The "VR Locomotion" experiment from the **Lab**.
    - The "History of VR" node from the **Garden**.
    - The "Future of Immersion" essay from **Thoughts**.
- **Implementation**: This required a dynamic route `src/pages/topics/[tag].astro` that queries *all three* content collections simultaneously and merges them.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Details: The Micro-Decisions

### 1. Typography: Space Grotesk
We needed a font that said "Future" but not "Robot".
- **Why Space Grotesk?**: It has the geometric precision of a tech font, but it has "quirky" curves (like the lowercase 'r' and 'g'). It feels tailored and human, not default.

### 2. The Navigation Bar philosophy
*Conversation: "Where do we put the topics?"*
- **Decision**: Keep the Top Nav **stable** and **minimal** (Garden, Lab, Thoughts, About).
- **Reasoning**: If we put "VR", "AI", "Web" in the top hub, the menu becomes a mess as you learn new things. The Top Nav is for "Where am I regarding content *type*?". The Body is for "What *subject* am I exploring?".

### 3. The Interactive "Hero"
We didn't just want a static image.
- **The Dream**: A 3D/Canvas background that reacts to the mouse.
- **The Compromise**: For V1, we used css-driven gradients and glass effects to simulate depth. The *real* 3D interactivity is reserved for the individual "Lab" posts (using MDX) to keep the homepage load time instant.

## 🔮 Unfinished Thoughts & Future Roadmap
*Ideas we touched on but haven't fully built yet.*

1.  **The "Mind Map" Visualization**:
    - *Idea*: A literal 3D graph view of your notes (Obsidian-style) on the deployments.
    - *Status*: Deferred. We need more content first for this to look good.

2.  **"Seedling" vs "Tree" Indicators**:
    - *Idea*: Visually distinguishing "Garden" nodes by their maturity (Stub vs Complete).
    - *Status*: The frontmatter `stage: seedling` exists, but we haven't added the visual icons yet.

3.  **The VR Entry Point**:
    - *Idea*: A "WebXR" button that launches the site in an immersive mode.
    - *Status*: Reserved for a future "Lab" experiment.

## 🏁 Summary of Requirements for Maintenance
1.  **Never lose the Warmth**: If it starts looking like a Bootstrap template, we failed.
2.  **Content is King**: The `src/content/` folder is the brain. The code is just the body.
3.  **Keep it "Between Binary"**: The site must exist in the tension between "Structured Code" (Binary) and "Organic Thought" (Between). It is a **Digital Garden**, not a filing cabinet.
